# streamlit visualization-app for the Data Visualization project in S7 at EFREI with Hatim CHAHDI

#First, I import streamlit, pandas and plotly that is the only external chart librairy I will use.

#The sample function allow the user to import the full dataset and sample it. Or, by modyfing the code, the user can import ll the dataset and sample it directly on streamlit with a checkbox if he want.

#I've made a function -thank to the slidebar- and the possibility for the user to visualize all the year from 2016 to 2020
#There is the map and bar function who are internal chart of streamlit to pseedly visualize the dataset on a geographical dimension or number dimension.
#Then, There is the 4 plotly chart (pie, bar, line and histogram) who are configure for the dataset

#Unfortunatly, when I put it online, there is an error "ModuleNotFound" who is not appaering on the computer. I don't find how to resolve it.
